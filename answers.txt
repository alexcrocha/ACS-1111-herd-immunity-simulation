1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
> python3 simulation.py 100000 0.9 Ebola 0.7 0.25

- Virus: Ebola
- Mortality Rate: 70%
- Basic Reproduction: 25%
- Population Size: 100000
- Vaccination Percentage: 90%
- Initial Infected: 10

2. What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
100%

3. What percentage of the population died from the virus?
6.32%

4. Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
853360
